Description: This includes functions that rely on BirdFlowR and a BirdFlow
    model. They are in this second repository either because they are only 
    likely to be useful to a subset of BirdFlowR users, or they depend on 
    packages that are not on CRAN - in which case including them in BirdFlowR 
    would make it CRAN incompatible. 
    The initial motivation for a separate package was the calc_birdflow_mc()
    function, but others will likely be added over time.
